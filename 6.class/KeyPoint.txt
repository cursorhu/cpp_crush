1. Basic Concepts
    Classes are the most important feature in C++. 
    Early versions of the language were named "C with Classes," emphasizing the central role of the class facility.

2. First look at class
    we know public, private for member function and member data
    and know how to define member function out of class. member function and member data have same class object scope.
    key points:
        * constructor initializer list
        * how to create an class object
        * object's this pointer and what it used for.
    refer to 6.1 screen

3. Rule of Three
    if a class needs a destructor, it will also need the assignment operator and a copy constructor.
    This rule is often referred to as the Rule of Three
    key points:
        * copy constructor
        * assignment operator constructor
        * destructor
    refer to 6.2 Student

4. Class with Pointer
    Be carefule when class have pointer member. 
    a buffer is usually created in constructor for the pointer member, 
    and make sure the buffer is freed in destructor !
    make sure deep-copy (copy the buffer but not just pointer itself) in copy-constructor !
    A smart_ptr class can be used to count how may object share a pointer
